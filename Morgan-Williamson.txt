Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? * Block elements in HTML will split and create a new line, whereas inline elements can be contained within blocks without interrupting flow. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? * The element positions itself near the closest positioned element, or positions relative to the body of the page itself.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? * Using the max-width styling rule, and then applying margin/padding.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default. * 
    Block: <p>, <li>, <div> .  Inline: <button>, <img> . Inline-block: <span>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? *
    The box model is the design by which we modify elements through CSS. The box model contains padding, margin, and borders for individual elements, and allows us to modify how each piece is spaced on the page. Using this, we could make sure every individual element respects the rules we give other elements without having to apply them directly.
